# VULT
Vult is an easy to use program for password-encrypted text. More file support will be added soon! (mp3, mp4, etc.)

## Installation:
**ONLY WINDOWS SUPPORTED**
Make sure [Python 3.10.5](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.5/python-3.10.5-amd64.exe) is downloaded. To make sure, run `python --version` in your command prompt.
Now, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory Vult is located.
Finally, you can now run Vult by running `python main.py` or just by double-clicking `main.py`
